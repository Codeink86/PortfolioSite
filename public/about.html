<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a single mom in Palmer, Alaska. I have had a passion for problem solving which has translated well with coding. I live with my daughter, our cats, and dog. 
  I currently work cleaning houses, managing Airbnb's, and as a personal assistant. 
  My goal is to be a software or web developer. I have a passion for learning, and learning happens to be one of my strengths. </p>

  <p>I have been at my current job for about 2 years, before that I was a stay at home mom after working in Neurology and Pediatrics for 4 years as a medical assistant. 
  </p>

  I will continue working to learn as much as I can about being in tech and I look forward to making a career out of it. My daughter will some day follow in my footsteps as she is already interested in coding.
